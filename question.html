            <h1> What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
            <p>The record object version (DOM) is a programming interface for web files. It represents the web page in
                shape, fashion, and content material.

                The purpose of the DOM is to provide a way for applications to have interaction with and manipulate the
                content material and shape of an HTML document.

                The DOM organizes the file as a hierarchical tree structure, where each node represents an
                detail,characteristic, or piece of text.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods?</h1>
            <p>
                To select HTML elements using the DOM you can use a many of methods. Here are some of the most common
                DOM methods used for selecting elements are given below

                1. document.getElementById() <br>
                2. document.getElementsByClassName() <br>
                3. document.getElementsByTagName() <br>
                4. document.querySelector() <br>
                5. document.querySelectorAll() <br>
                6. document.getElementsByName() <br>

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>What is event bubble?</h1>
            <p>
                event effervescent is a mechanism in the file object version (DOM) in which an event this is prompted on
                a specific detail can also trigger the identical event on all of its determine elements, propagating up
                the DOM tree.
                while an occasion is triggered on an element, the event first receives handled by way of that precise
                detail's occasion listener (if one is described). After that, the occasion propagates up the DOM tree,
                triggering the identical occasion on each of the determine elements, one after the alternative, until it
                reaches the topmost ancestor element.

            <h1>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
            <p>
                In JavaScript, a callback characteristic is a characteristic that is handed as a controversy to another
                characteristic and is done through that characteristic at some point in time. The function that receives
                the callback is chargeable for calling it and passing any vital arguments.

                The primary reason to use a callback characteristic is to allow asynchronous code execution, wherein
                code execution isn't always blocked at the same time as watching for a response from an external useful
                resource. Callback functions can be used to address the result of the asynchronous operation once it
                completes.

                every other use case for callback features is to permit for modularity and code reuse. Callback
                functions can be exceeded as arguments to higher-order functions, that can then be reused with specific
                callback features to carry out distinct moves.
